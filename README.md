#mytunes
In this sprint, my pair and I use Backbone.js to implement a browser-based music player. We implemented a song queue with some basic add/remove functionality. In addition, we prioritized the design and usability of the application such that we ourselves would want to use it.

The most challenging part about the project was conceptualizing the existing application architecture. Learning to think about the application as small and conceptually isolated parts, interacting as parts of a larger system, helped us develop our intuition about where to modify the code.

####Note
This is a project I completed as a student at [hackreactor](http://hackreactor.com). This project was worked on with a pair.
